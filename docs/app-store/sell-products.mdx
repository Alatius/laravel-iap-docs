# Sell Products

There are two types of products you can sell, **Consumables** and **Non-Consumables**. Consumable in-app purchases
are depleted as they are used and **Can be purchased multiple times**, for example, lives or gems in a game, or a
boosts in a dating app. Non-consumable in-app purchases are purchased once and **Can only be purchased once**, for
example, additional filters in a photo app, or cosmetic items in a game.

## Create products

To offer in-app purchases inside your app, you need to add their information in App Store Connect.

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/).
2. From **My App**, select your app.
3. In the sidebar, under **Features**, select **In-App Purchases**.
4. Click the add button (+).

5. Select **Consumable** or **Non-Consumable**.
6. Fill the form by adding the reference name and product ID.
7. Click the **Create** button.

## Validate receipts

An App Store receipt is a binary encrypted file signed with an Apple certificate. Your mobile application should
receive the receipt once a successful purchase is made, and you should validate the receipt on your server to ensure
that the purchase is valid.

You can verify the receipt using the `Product` Facade as follows:

```php title="ProductController.php"
use Imdhemy\Purchases\Facades\Product;
use Exception;

// Verify the receipt on App Store
$receiptResponse = Product::appStore()->receiptData($receipt)->verifyReceipt();

// Check the values of the response to verify transactions as needed.
$receipt = $receiptResponse->getReceipt();
$inAppList = $receipt->getInApp(); // contains all purchased products

// Depending on your business, you can loop over all products, or just the first one.
$productPurchased = false;
foreach ($inAppList as $inApp) {
    if ($inApp->getProductId() === $productId) {
        $productPurchased = true;
        break;
    }
}

if ($productPurchased) {
    // Do something with the product
}

throw new Exception('Product not purchased');
```

## Available methods

The returned object from the validation is an instance of `\Imdhemy\AppStore\Receipts\ReceiptResponse`, which
represents the [response body](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstorereceipts/responsebody) returned from App Store.

For any property, describe in the App Store documentation, there is a `getter` method that returns its value.
The getter method names are the same as the property names, except that are prefixed with `get` and are `camelCase`.

For example, the `getEnvironment()` method returns the `environment` property.

If the property is an array/JSON object, the returned value will be an instance of a class that represents that
object. The same idea of `getter` methods applies to the returned class.
