# Usage outside Laravel

If you are not using Laravel, you can still use the [App Store IAP package](https://github.com/imdhemy/appstore-iap).
We will show you how to do this in this section.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require imdhemy/appstore-iap
```

## Receipt Verification

To verify a receipt, you need to create an instance of the `Verifier` class and call the `verify()` method. The `Verifier`
class accepts three parameters:

1. The Http Client, and you should decide which one to use, a production or a sandbox client.
2. The receipt data, which is a base64 encoded string.
3. The password, which is the shared secret of your app.

:::tip
Make sure you don't hardcode the `password` in your code, you should use an environment variable instead.
:::

```php
use Imdhemy\AppStore\ClientFactory;

$client = ClientFactory::create();
$sandboxClient = ClientFactory::createSandbox();

$receiptData = 'base64 encoded receipt data';
$password = 'your shared secret'; // don't hardcode this

$verifier = new Verifier($client, $receiptData, $password);
$excludeOldTransactions = true;

$receipt = $verifier->verify($excludeOldTransactions, $sandboxClient);

// Get the receipt status
$receiptStatus = $receipt->getStatus();

if ($receiptStatus->isValid()) {
    // The receipt is valid
} else {
    // The receipt is invalid
}
```

:::tip
You can find more about Selling subscriptions and products on the [App Store section](/docs/category/app-store).

## Server Notifications

App Store IAP package supports both `v1` and `v2` server notifications. Just make sure which version is set in you App Store
Connect account. For both versions, you need to create an endpoint or a route to handle the notifications received from the
App Store.

### V2 Server Notifications (Recommended)

```php
use Imdhemy\AppStore\Jws\Parser;
use Imdhemy\AppStore\Jws\AppStoreJwsVerifier;

$signedPayload = $request->getSignedPayload(); // Should be the request body received from the App Store
$jws = Parser::toJws($signedPayload);
$verifier = new AppStoreJwsVerifier();
if ($verifier->verify($jws)) {
    // The notification is valid

    $decodedPayload = V2DecodedPayload::fromJws($jws);
    // Then you have access to the notification attributes

} else {
    // The notification is invalid
}

```

### V1 Server Notifications

```php
use Imdhemy\AppStore\ServerNotifications\ServerNotification;

$attributes = $request->all(); // Should be the request body
$serverNotification = ServerNotification::fromArray($attributes);

// Then you have access to the notification attributes
$eventType = $serverNotification->getNotificationType();

// based on the event type, you can get the related attributes
```
