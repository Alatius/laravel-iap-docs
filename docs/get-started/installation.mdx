### Routing

LIAP provides you a route to receive the server notifications. The `routing`
key allows you to secure this route. Check
the [routing](/docs/get-started/routing) document for detailed information.

### Event Listeners

[Server Notifications](/docs/category/server-notifications) is a
server-to-server service that notifies you in real time when the status of
in-app purchases and refunds changes. Use the data in the notifications to
update your user-account database, and to monitor and respond to in-app
purchase refunds.

**LIAP** provides you with a complete list of events that you can listen to.
Check [Event Listeners](/docs/get-started/event-listeners) to learn how to use them.
