# Installation

Install the package via composer:

```shell
composer require imdhemy/laravel-purchases
```

## Configuration

Publish the config file:

```shell
php artisan liap:config:publish
```

This creates a file `config/liap.php` which contains 4 main keys:

- `routing`: Which allows you to add custom routing configurations.
- `google_play_package_name`: The default Google play package name.
- `appstore_password`: The default [App Store password](/docs/credentials/app-store).
- `eventListeners`: A List of Store events and event handlers.

:::caution
You need to set up Google Play Account Credentials. It's not added to the `config/liap.php` file.
Follow this ðŸ‘‰ [`Guide`](/docs/credentials/google-play) to set it up.

### Routing

LIAP provides you a route to receive the server notifications. The `routing`
key allows you to secure this route. Check
the [routing](/docs/get-started/routing) document for detailed information.

### Event Listeners

[Server Notifications](/docs/category/server-notifications) is a
server-to-server service that notifies you in real time when the status of
in-app purchases and refunds changes. Use the data in the notifications to
update your user-account database, and to monitor and respond to in-app
purchase refunds.

**LIAP** provides you with a complete list of events that you can listen to.
Check [Event Listeners](/docs/get-started/event-listeners) to learn how to use them.
