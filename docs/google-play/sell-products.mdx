# Sell Products

You can use Google Play yo sell **One-time** products that are of two types:

- **Consumable Product**: is one that a user consumes to receive in-game content. When a user consumes your product, you
dispense the associated benefits or effects in a process known as provisioning. For example, you might sell a consumable
stack of gold coins that a user can use to purchase in-game items. When the user consumes the product, you deduct the coins
from the user's account and provide the user with the in-game items.

- **Non-Consumable Product**: is one that a user purchases once and retains forever. For example, you might sell a non-consumable
product that unlocks a premium feature in your app.

## Validate Receipts

Google Play tracks purchases with a purchase token and a transaction id. You can use the following code to validate a receipt.

```php title='ProductController.php'
use \Imdhemy\Purchases\Facades\Product;
use \Imdhemy\GooglePlay\Products\ProductPurchase;

/** @var ProductPurchase $productReceipt */
$productReceipt = Product::googlePlay()->id($itemId)->token($purchaseToken)->get();
```

A success response means a valid receipt that is an instance of `Imdhemy\GooglePlay\Products\ProductPurchase`. The `ProductPurchase`
instance has a list of getter methods named after the [response keys](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/rest/v3/purchases.products#ProductPurchase). For example the `getKind()` method returns the value of the `kind` key.
