# Sell Subscriptions

A subscription is a set of benefits that a user can access during a stated time period.

## Validate Receipts

To validate a subscription receipt, you need to send the receipt to your server and verify it with Google Play. You can use
the `Subscription` facade to do this.

```php
use Imdhemy\GooglePlay\Subscriptions\SubscriptionPurchase;
use Imdhemy\Purchases\Facades\Subscription;

// To verify a subscription receipt
/** @var SubscriptionPurchase $subscriptionReceipt */
$subscriptionReceipt = Subscription::googlePlay()->id($itemId)->token($purchaseToken)->get();
```

A success response will return a `SubscriptionPurchase` object that contains getters for all the [available fields](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/rest/v3/purchases.subscriptions#resource:-subscriptionpurchase).
