# Testing and Mocking

LIAP is build with testing and mocking in mind. This means that you can test your app without actually making a purchase.
The only thing you need to do is to mock the receipt or a server notification and then test your app.

## Testing with a mocked receipt

Follow the steps below to mock a receipt and test your app.

Create an instance from the `GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Response` with the required response body, for instance a [subscription purchase resource](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/rest/v3/purchases.subscriptions#SubscriptionPurchase).

If you are looking for a code snippet example, Let's mock an auto-renewing subscription purchase.

```php
<?php

namespace Test\Feature;

use GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Response;
use Imdhemy\GooglePlay\ClientFactory;
use \Imdhemy\Purchases\Facades\Subscription;


class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
  public function test_example(): void
  {
    $responseBody = [
      "kind" => "androidpublisher#subscriptionPurchase",
      "startTimeMillis" => "1580000000000",
      "expiryTimeMillis" => "1580000000000",
      "autoRenewing" => true,
      "priceCurrencyCode" => "USD",
      "priceAmountMicros" => "1000000",
      "countryCode" => "US",
       // Other fields are omitted for brevity
    ];

    $response = new Response(200, [], json_encode($responseBody));
    $client = ClientFactory::mock($response);

    // use the client to verify the purchase
    // The returned attributes are the same as the mocked response

    // THE FOLLOWING LINE SHOULD BE IN YOUR CLIENT CODE
    $receipt = Subscription::googlePlay($client)->id($itemId)->token($token)->get();
  }
}

```
