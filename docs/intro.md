# Introduction

Laravel In-App Purchases (**LIAP**) contains everything you need to implement
and manage in-app purchases and subscriptions.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è LIAP will help you manage the subscription life-cycle for Google Play and App Store.
- ‚è≥ Using real receipts on development is boring, LIAP lets you mock receipts.
- üßê LIAP helps you to write a testable code.

**LIAP** was designed from the ground up to be easily installed and used to get your in-app purchases features up and
running quickly. It gives you the required tools to mock receipts during development. No need to real receipts from
different providers.

## Get started resources

Here are a few ways to get started:

- [Package installation](/docs/get-started/installation).
- Store setup and products configuration.
- Configuring server notifications.
- Best practices and code examples.

## Discussions and QA

Feel free to join our humble community on Github.

- [Laravel](https://github.com/imdhemy/laravel-in-app-purchases/discussions) discussion board.
- [Google Play Billing](https://github.com/imdhemy/google-play-billing/discussions) discussion board.
- [App Store IAP](https://github.com/imdhemy/appstore-iap/discussions) discussion board.

## Technical decisions

LIAP is a wrapper over two packages App Store IAP and Google Play Billing. Developing and maintaining separate packages
per store gives us the ability to re-use the code to support different PHP frameworks. We started by Laravel, but
supporting other Frameworks is planned, the next one will be Symfony. In addition to code re-usability, separate
packages opens the door to support more stores and service providers in the future.

The current version supports Google Play and App Store. Good to mention that App Store Notifications `v2` is not
supported, but it will be supported in the next release.
