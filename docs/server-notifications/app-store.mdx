App Store Server Notifications should be set up in App Store Connect with
the URL provided by LIAP. Refer to [Generating signed URLs](/docs/get-started/routing#generate-a-signed-url) to
learn how to
generate this URL.

The generated URL will something like this:

```https://<your-site>/liap/notifications?provider=app-store```.

Based on your configuration, it may be altered to include the `signature`
and other
[routing](/docs/get-started/routing) parameters.

1. Generate app store URL.
2. Log in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) and select your app.
3. Under the **App Information** > **App Store Server Notifications** section,
paste
the URL you generated in step 1 in both the **Production Server URL** and the
**Sandbox Server URL** fields.
4. Select Version 1 Notifications. __(Version 2 notifications are not
supported yet.)__

:::info
If your server requires IP addresses to be on an allow list,
add the IP address subnet 17.0.0.0/8 to allow your server to receive notifications
from the App Store server. This subnet applies to both the sandbox and the production environments
