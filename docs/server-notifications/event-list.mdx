### How to track refunds in Google Play

There are two ways for a user to [request refund](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637?hl=en)
for a subscription in Google Play: either by sending a request to Google or
by contacting the developer.

If a user requests a refund from the developer, you as a developer can keep
track of the process. However, if a user requests a refund from Google, you
will not receive any notification if the refund is successful or not.

From the developers experience, there is an indirect way to track refunds.
after a subscription is refunded two real-time events are sent:
`SubscriptionCanceled` followed by `SubscriptionRevoked`.

On your server, you can treat the `SubscriptionCanceled` event as a normal
cancel, then if that event is followed by a `SubscriptionRevoked` event, you
can mark it as a refund.
