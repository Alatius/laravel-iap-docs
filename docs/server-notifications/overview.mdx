# Overview

LIAP supports Google Play Realtime Developer Notifications and App Store
Server Notifications out of the box. Server notifications is a mechanism to
receive push notifications from the service provider (Google Play or Apple)
whenever there is a change in user's subscription status. These
notifications allow you to immediately react to subscription changes,
avoiding the need to poll the APIs for updates.

:::note
Note that inefficient use of the Google Play Developer API can lead to API
quota restrictions. So, it is recommended to depend on the server notifications.
